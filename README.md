Daily Cosmos

 I built this application to interact with the NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day using NASA API. It fetches a new image and fun fact about space every day.

You can view the live site here: https://dailycosmos.pavongurung.me

What it does

I wanted to create a simple way to browse NASA's daily images. The site connects to the NASA API and displays the title, date, explanation, and media (image or video) for the day.

Key features:

Automatically loads the current picture of the day.

Includes a date picker so you can go back and see pictures from the past.

Supports both images and videos (like YouTube embeds).

Responsive design that works on phones and desktops.

Handles API errors gracefully (switches to a backup image if the API limit is reached).

Technologies Used

HTML5 & JavaScript (ES6)

Tailwind CSS for styling

NASA Open API

How to run it

Since this is a static site, you don't need to install any dependencies.

Open the index.html file in any web browser.
